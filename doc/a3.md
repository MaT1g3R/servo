# Diagnose

The `folow_hyperlink` method for HTML anchor/area elements implements an out dated
version of [this algorithm](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#following-hyperlinks-2).
Changing this behaviour to match the up to date spec will make the method correct,
and easier to understand for future maintainers. There are little risks involved,
as long as the tests still pass after this change.

# Solution

Change the algorithm to match the current spec, and refactor out some dead code
in the process.

# Testing Plan

After my change in [htmlanchorelement.rs](https://github.com/MaT1g3R/servo/commit/e4ffd164495cada2f37741c3ce674d990103c34b),
the `follow_hyperlink` method now matches the up to date spec.
